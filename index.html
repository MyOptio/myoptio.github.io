        <h2>What is Optio?</h2>
        <div class="twothirds">
            <p class="mt mb ">Optio uses a complex algorithm to match individuals to their ideal accountability partners. Optio then provides the platform, technology, and tools needed for a positive, successful partnership.  Optio’s built-in accountability enables you to set personal goals and see them through to completion with an astounding success rate.  Using a one-of-a-kind digital platform, Optio encourages deep and often unexpected personal alliances to develop. Optio will give you access to develop profound relationships; it will stretch you to become the best version of yourself, and help you grow into the person you were made to be.</p>
            <h3>All of this, to achieve a better you… a better relationship… a better world.</h3>

          <p>Combining psychographic and demographic data, Optio utilizes a uniquely optimized mathematical algorithm to match you to your ideal accountability partner.</p>
          <p>Optio then facilitates weekly Guided Accountability sessions that enable you to design the life you want, and then create and achieve goals to move in the direction of that design. Your partner will be equipped with the tools and resources to see you through to the actualization of those goals, and you, theirs. Optis rotate accountability partners every thirteen weeks, providing a window into worlds typically unseen - expanding our views of the role we can play at large.</p>
          <p>During the thirteen-week quarter, Opti members will work together to design affirmations, create and set goals, and then together, fulfill those commitments.  The initial meeting, which is week one, will include an introduction and an affirmation creation process. Then, during the quarter, Opti members will meet via video chat to hold one another accountable and guide each other toward success.</p>
          <p>Success is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice. Optio does the initial work for you. We take you to a 95% success rate. All you have to do is show up and be willing to define and live your best life.</p>

            <h3><a href="#">What makes someone an ideal Opti/Optio member?</a></h3>
            <div id="definition" class="hidden">
                <p>We have a specific definition of what it means to be an Opti.</p>
                <p>An Opti is defined to be an individual for which all of the following statements are true:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>I am willing to grow</li>
                <li>I am willing to help others grow</li>
                <li>I am willing to share my story to help others grow</li>
                <li>I am willing to listen to others to enable my own growth</li>
                <li>I am able to commit to a weekly conversation to keep the growth moving</li>
                </ul>
                <p>An Optio Member is an individual actively participating in a Guided Accountability pairing. Members are expected to participate, as defined below.</p>
                <p>Responsibilities:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Members agree to set up an affirmation creation session and set up the guiding call/video chat structure for the next thirteen weeks.</li>
                <li>Members agree to participate in weekly guided accountability sessions during the quarter, following the established Opti format (pairs take turns guiding each other).</li>
                <li>Members agree to have a final session to prepare to transition to the next quarter, and reflect on their own growth as an individual and as a partner. This takes place in the thirteenth week.</li>
                <li>Members agree to communicate to their partner and/or MyOptio.org in a timely fashion if they realize that any issues or concerns may prevent them from following any of the guidelines outlined above to the individual they are paired with.</li>
                <li>Members agree to be responsible for their own actions and commitments and to hold their partner to the same standard.</li>
                <li>At the end of a quarter, if a member chooses to be paired with another Opti; they agree to continue their participation for the next thirteen weeks.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3><a href="#">What kind of commitment are we asking of our Opti’s?</a></h3>
            <div id="commitment" class="hidden">
                <p>Accountability partners are matched together for 13 consecutive weeks. You are obligated to see your partner through, touching base once a week, until the completion of your quarter.  But don’t worry: we don’t leave you hanging.  We equip you with a process to structure each week in order to get the most out of your time together, and tools to center and focus your growth in a way that you can benefit not only from your partner, but the Optio community at large, should you choose to.</p>
            </div>
            <h3><a href="#">What does participating in Optio look like week to week?</a></h3>
            <div id="weekly" class="hidden">
                <p><strong>Week 1: The Affirmation Process </strong></p>
                <p>To begin the guided accountability process, your pair meets for one to three hours of focused time in which each person creates their quarterly affirmation<strong><em>, </em></strong>or vision statement. Then, with your accountability partner, you design a structure to realize your affirmation. Limiting beliefs and fears are identified then crushed. Goals for the quarter are set, as well as specific plans to attain those goals, and strategies to overcome the inevitable roadblocks that will land in your path. Finally, you agree on a method and time for meeting the remaining 12 weeks of the quarter. Schedules are factored into Optio&rsquo;s matching algorithm to make this a smooth process. Don&rsquo;t stress.</p>
                <p><strong>Weeks 2-12: Weekly Guided Accountability Structure</strong></p>
                <p>Your pair will meet by video chat for approximately 45-60 minutes, according to the schedule you set in week one. Half the time will be spent holding your partner accountable to the goals and intentions they have set, and the other half will be spent being held accountable yourself. Each week will have an accompanying theme on which to focus part of your time. Opti&rsquo;s are encouraged to guide one another in such a way that the person sees oneself as the result of an already fulfilled affirmation and sees the power that can be sourced from within and derived from this type of accountability. During these calls you agree to take actions related to your goals, and report on your results of the past week.</p>
                <p>Sometimes pairs also have 2- 3 minute check-in calls or accountability texts in the middle of the week to remind one another of what was discussed.</p>
                <p><strong>Week 13: Transition Process</strong></p>
                <p>At the end of your quarter each Opti will complete a Transition sheet. This allows you to see how you&rsquo;ve grown and what you&rsquo;ve completed throughout the quarter. It&rsquo;s also an opportunity to realize what you did not complete and would like to continue working on, and what you would like to take forward with you into the next quarter, with your new accountability partner. During the final week, you will discuss these things with your partner and acknowledge them for their accountability, their commitment to guiding you through to completion, and for their growth and progression both as an individual and as a partner in this season.</p>
